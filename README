you should not get any error messages otherwise something is not correctly installed

Note: some of those utilities are provied in the following package in case your don't want to build the whole source code for those softwares.

	http://evolution.sysu.edu.cn/software/utilities.tar.gz


Getting started
==============================================================================================================================

miREvo can either operates via a Graphical User Interface (GUI) or from the command-line interface (CLI).
The options and parameters in the GUI are almost the samve as the (CLI).

The GUI also provides as a graphical interface to view many of the results and results can be more lively  presented in
GUI. You can also use the GUI to view your the result run from command-line interface. 

whether the project was assembled using the GUI or the CLI. Results appear as output files 
using either the GUI or the CLI. 

You can take a look at the command line parameters and available tools using

	miREvo or miREvo_tk

Further information on each of the tools can be retrieved by the command pattern

	miREvo <toolname>

for instance in the step of the filter sequencing reads

	miREvo filter 


Examples & Demos
==============================================================================================================================

We provide two sample project, which can be downloaded at

	http://evolution.sysu.edu.cn/software/dme_demo.tar.gz or
	http://evolution.sysu.edu.cn/software/ath_demo.tar.gz

These packages contains files for the two demos used in our miREvo software paper, Drosophila melanogaster and Arabidopsis thaliana.
Take the file dme_demo.tar.gz for example, this is a full demo for analysis of small RNA library generated from Drosophila melanogaster. 
To run these project, you should have a Linux machine with at least 4 Gb RAM. This is mainly due to that miREvo (mafsInRegion) need to read 
through the whole MAF file in ortholog extracting step. 

To start the demo,  do:

	tar xzvf dme_demo.tar.gz
	cd dme_demo
	bowtie-build -f dme_repeat/databse.fas dme_repeat/databse
	bowtie-build -f dme_mirbase/dme.hairpin.fa dme_mirbase/dme.hairpin
	miREvo filter -i dme_reads.fa -d dme_repeat/database -H dme_mirbase/dme.hairpin  -M dme_mirbase/dme.mature.fa -o dme -p 10
	bowtie-build -f dme_chr/reference.fas dme_chr/reference
	miREvo predict -o dme -r dme_chr/reference -M dme_mirbase/dme.mature.fa -s dme_mirbase/mature.nodme.fa -c -g 20000 -p 10	
	bowtie-build -f dme/predict.hairpin.fa dme/predict.hairpin
	miREvo homoseq -i dme/filter.kn.nomap.fas -H dme/predict.hairpin -M dme/predict.mature.fa -r dme_chr/reference.fas -s dme_mirbase/mature.nodme.fa -m dm3.maf -o dme -p 10

To indentify the homology sequence of all known miRNA for Drosophila melanogaster , do

	miREvo homoseq -i dme_reads.fa -H dme_mirbase/dme.hairpin -M dme_mirbase/dme.mature.fa -r dme_chr/reference.fas -m dm3.maf -s dme_mirbase/mature.nodme.fa -o kwn -p 10


For the Graphical User Interface. type:

	cd dme_demo
	miREvo_tk
	1) Click button New to create a new project.
	2) Click button Open to open a project previously run.

Then follow the instructions to go on you operation.

Input File Annotatoins:
	-- dme_reads.fas: This is a small RNA reads library sequenced using Solexa 1G.
	-- dme_repeat/databse.fas: Fasta sequenced contains structure RNA (tRNA, transposon, etc.) or mRNA sequenced, 
							   reads mapped to this sequences will be removed from the reads data set.
	-- dme_mirbase/*.fa: The miRNAs of drosophila which previously indentified, downloaded from miRBase.
	-- dme_chr/*.fa: The genome sequence of D. melanogaster (dm3), downloaded from UCSC.
	-- dm3.maf: Multiple alignments of 14 insects with D. melanogaster (dm3), downloaded from UCSC.

Output File Annotatoins:
	See the following parts of this manual.

We also provide a simple solution to compare the expression of orthologous miRNAs across multiple libraries.
The is implemented as a perl script runing as:

	perl compare_exp.pl reference_genome homoseq_prj predict_prj1 predict_prj2 ...... predict_prjN

In the above command, compare_exp.pl is provided in utilities.tar.gz in our miREvo web site. reference_genome is the reference genome of one of your 
interested species, which is also the reference genome of the MAF (WGAs) file; For example, the the reference_genome for tair8-11species.maf is 
araTHA8. homoseq_prj is a project generated by "miREvo homoseq" command. predict_prj1, predict_prj2, ..., is the projects generated by "miREvo predict" 
command and so on.
For more detailed information, see dro_orth_exp.readme (http://evolution.sysu.edu.cn/software/dro_orth_exp.readme) in miREvo web site.


Usage
==============================================================================================================================

filter 

	Description:
	Small RNA reads are filtered out from the complex small RNA sequencing libraries following these two steps: 
	Firstly is the unwanted reads derived from any types of structure RNAs present in the cell, such as tRNA, rRNA annotated in Rfam;
	RNA derived form repeat/transposon presented in RepBase; since most annotated miRNAs in miRBase are presented in intergenic region
	reads coresponed to mRNA/coding sequening can also be discarded.
	Seconedly is the reads representd for the known miRNA in the corresponding species, if it is provided. Their expression is also 
	determined in this step, using quantifier.pl provided in miRDeep2 package.
	The remaining reads are then used for novel miRNA prediction.

	Input:
	1) Sequencing reads in the collapsed suffix fasta format.
	Collapses reads in the fasta file to ensure that each sequence only occurs once. To indicate how
	many times reads the sequence represents, a suffix is added to each fasta identifier. E.g. a
	sequence that represents ten reads in the data will have the '_x10' suffix added to the identifier.  
	You can collapse reads with collapse_reads.pl provided by miRDeep2:
	collapse_reads.pl reads.fa > reads_collapsed
	2) Bowtie index databse cantains the unwanted sequence descripted above, for instance:
	cat repeat.fas Rfam.cantains.no.mir.fas mRNA.fas anyother.fas > databse.fas
	bowtie-built -f databse.fas databse
	3) Bowtie index databse for hairpin sequence for known miRNAs, please provided this if you only wanted
	to predict novel miRNAs.

	Example usage:
	miREvo filter -i reads.fa -d /dir/to/databse -H /dir/to/hairpin -o prj -p 10 


	Output:
	All the output file will be dump to the "prj" folder (specified by the option "-o"), usefull file are:
	1) filter.statistic, basic statistic for the reads mappings and expression evaluation for known miRNAs.
	2) filter.kn.map, reads distribution along each known miRNA.
	3) filter.kn.nomap.fas reads
	
	Notes:
	In miREvo, the fasta sequences corresponded for the bowtie index may be also needed in some steps. For example, 
	if you provide bowtie index as "/dir/to/hairpin", miREvo will look for the corresponding fasta file in the format
	as "/dir/to/hairpin.fa", "/dir/to/hairpin.fas" or "/dir/to/hairpin.fasta". Please name them in that format and
	build the bowtie index in the rigth way.

predict

	Description:
	Perform a microRNA prediction by using deep sequencing reads.
		
	Input:
	1) filter.kn.nomap.fas, one of the outputs after the "filter" step.
	2) Bowtie index databse for genome sequence.
	3) Fasta file with known miRNA mature  sequence for your species.

	Example usage:
	miREvo predict -o prj -d /dir/to/genome -M /dir/to/mature.fas -s /dir/to/other.mature.fas -p 10 -m 1

	Output:
	1) predict.result.csv, miRDeep2 report prediction result.
	2) predict.result.html, miRDeep2 report prediction result, html format.
	3) predict.mirna.map, reads distribution along each predicted miRNA.
	4) predict.hairpin.fa, hairpin sequences for predicted miRNAs;
	5) predict.mature.fa, mature sequences for predicted miRNAs;
	6) predict.statistic, basic statistic for reads mappings and expression evaluation for predicted miRNAs.

	Notes:
	Characterization of plant miRNAs are considerable different from animal miRNAs, for example, plant miRNAs may possess 
	a larger families and long hairpin sequence. By setting the rigth parameters for options "-k","-m" , miREvo will 
	tolerated more repeat mapping and will adjust to the parameters developed specificly for plant miRNA discovery.

homoseq

	Description:
	Fetching the homology alignment for miRNA sequence.

	Input:
	1) Fasta file with deep sequencing reads.
	2) Fasta file with mirna mature sequence.
	3) Fasta file with mirna hairpin sequence.
	4) Bowtie index databse for genome reference sequence.
	5) Whole  genome alignment files, UCSC MAF format.

	Example usage:
	miREvo homoseq -o prj -i /dir/to/reads.fa -M /dir/to/mature.fa -H /dir/to/hairpin.fa -d /dir/to/reference -m /dir/to/maf -p 10

	Output:
	1) homoseq.slim.aln, alignment of homology sequence for each miRNA.
	2) homoseq.mirna.map reads distribution along each predicted miRNA.
	3) homoseq.statistic, basic statistic for reads mappings and expression evaluation for predicted miRNAs.
	4) homoseq.mirna.kmir, dna distance of miRNA hairpin (kmir), calculated based on Kimura 2-parameters model.

	Notes:
	1) For the command "homoseq" and "display" sequencs searching of miRNA precursors.
	The ids in files miRBase_mmu_v14.fa and precursors_ref_this_species.fa need to be similar to each other.
	This is usually no problem if you downloaded both files from miRBase.
	Otherwise it can happen that the quantifier fails to produce results. 
	2) MAF file must be contrusted by using the genome of your species as the reference genome.
	3) Please make sure that the chromsome name in the genome reference of your specie is the same as it present in the MAF file 
	Otherwise it can happen that miREvo fails to fetch the alignment. 

display

	Description:
	Generating graphic report for structure and reads distribution information of miRNA.

	Input:
	1) Fasta file with deep sequencing reads.
	2) Fasta file with mirna mature sequence.
	3) Fasta file with mirna hairpin sequence.

	Example usage:
	miREvo display -o prj -i /dir/to/reads.fa -M /dir/to/mature.fa -H /dir/to/hairpin.fa -p 10

	Output:
	1) display.mirna.map reads distribution along each miRNA.
	3) display.statistic, basic statistic for reads mappings and expression evaluation for miRNAs.

	Notes:
	For the "predict" step, the reads mapping and structure information of the known miRNAs would not be browsed in the GUI,
	otherwise, you can using this command to create a new project and using the GUI command "open a existing project" to display
	those information.
